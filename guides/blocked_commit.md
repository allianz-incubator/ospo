## What to Do When Your Commit Is Blocked
If your commit is blocked due to an exposed secret, follow these steps:

1. Determine which secret has been exposed in your commit.
2. Immediately revoke or rotate the exposed secret to prevent unauthorized access.
3. Remove the exposed secret from your codebase and replace it with a secure alternative.
4. Commit and push your changes again.
