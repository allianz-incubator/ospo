# Dependabot

Dependabot is a security feature designed to manage dependencies, ensuring the software project remains up-to-date with the latest library versions. The process scans dependency files like `package.json` or `pom.xml` to detect outdated libraries and automatically generates pull requests with proposed dependency updates. Dependabot is enabled by default for all repositories within the Allianz GitHub organization.

Dependabot's behavior can be customized. For more details, please refer to the official [documentation](https://docs.github.com/de/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file).
