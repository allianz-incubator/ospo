# Graduation from Incubator

## Purpose of Incubator

The [Incubator](https://github.com/allianz-incubator) at Allianz serves as a space for early-stage projects and is typically where new projects begin. Incomplete functionality, documentation gaps, or missing processes are accepted and considered part of the setup process.

## Graduation Readiness Checks

If you believe your project is ready for prime time, please check the following key criteria:

1. Functionality: Confirm that a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality is fully developed and operational.

2. Documentation: Ensure that comprehensive and accessible documentation is available for the project.

3. Best Practices: Validate that the project adheres to open source standards and [best practices](https://opensource.guide/).

## Initiate the Graduation Process

To kickstart the graduation process, either create a pull request on the configuration file [repos.yaml](../config/repos.yaml) or raise an issue.
