# Joining a Team 

## 1. Join the Github Organization

If you haven't done so yet, joining the *github.com/allianz* organization is the first step before becoming a part of a team. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open GIAM and search for "Allianz Open Source" ([details](https://allianzms.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/teams/DE1214-6256295/SitePages/Order-Allianz-Open-Source.aspx?csf=1&web=1&share=Ec2kpyWDp51FqZszJ9kvJH4BgYafc1EnTus8H2_IRdCzMg&e=uSVOfj))
2. Order the item.

After this initial step, you will receive a Github invitation after a few days. *Before* accepting, continue with the following steps:

3. Log in to Github with your private GitHub account. Do not use any auto-generated GitHub account that has been provided by the company. These accounts are restricted to internal development and cannot be utilized for open source contributions.
4. Add your Allianz email to your private Github account for proper contribution identification within the company context.
5. Accept the invitation.

## 2. Join the Team

1. Contact the current project maintainer to identify the GIAM group name necessary for repository access.
2. Open GIAM and search for the specific group name.
3. Order the item.

For those who created the GIAM group, it's important to note that they must also order the group themselves. The ordering process for creators differs from the standard procedure and is detailed [here](https://allianzms.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/teams/DE1214-6256295/SitePages/Order-own-GIAM-group.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=DF2jNc).
